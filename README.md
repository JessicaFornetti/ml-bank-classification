# ml-bank-classification

This project involves a classification task to predict the outcome of a bank marketing campaign using Python.

This project was completed as part of the course Master of Science in Computer Science (Data Science) at TU Dublin, Ireland.

The main steps of the project are outlined below:

- **Part 1 : Problem Definition, Kaggle Competition selected and why**
- **Part 2 : Data Exploration, Feature Engineering and Data Preparation** - Data exploration is carried out using SQL querries and their associated graphs
- **Part 3:  Model creation** - Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosted Tree Regressor models were built using 5 fold cross validation and a grid search to find the best hyperparameters for each model
- **Part 4: Model Evaluation and Explanations of Decision** - The models are compared and evaluated on the following metrics : R squared, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error and Explained Varriance. The predictions of each model are inspected and a comparaison between the predictions and the real labels is plotted, as well as the residuals plot and the distribution of the residuals.
- **Part 5: Discussion of work completed, competition outcomes, and highlighting features of Spark used**

Classification task to predict the outcome of a bank marketing campaign using Python. Data exploration using matplotlib and seaborn, explored different resampling methods (oversampling with SMOTE, under sampling with Random Undersampling). Feature selection using both filter and wrapper methods (information gain and forward sequential search) and grid search to find the best hyperparameters for each model were defined in a pipeline. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and SVM models were built and evaluated.
