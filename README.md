# ml-bank-classification

This project involves a classification task to predict the outcome of a bank marketing campaign using Python.

This project was completed as part of the course Master of Science in Computer Science (Data Science) at TU Dublin, Ireland.

The main steps of the project are outlined below:

- **Data Exploration** : 
- **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tunning** : 
- **Training The Best Model and Feature Selection** : 
- **Predictions on Queries Dataset** : 

Data exploration using matplotlib and seaborn, explored different resampling methods (oversampling with SMOTE, under sampling with Random Undersampling). Feature selection using both filter and wrapper methods (information gain and forward sequential search) and grid search to find the best hyperparameters for each model were defined in a pipeline. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and SVM models were built and evaluated.
